VI THE WISH IN DREAMS

The dream is a continuation of thinking in sleep.

Is it not strange that dreams should purely be wish fufillments?
We've seen before a disgused series of patterns and meanings hidden in dreams, but can we justify that they are all wish fufillements?

courpse dream - where a father reanacts a dangerous situation his child was in seemed provoked by the light of a flame.
A father, whose child has recently died, dreams that the body of the deceased child is in a room. In the dream, a candle falls, potentially setting fire to the body. The father concludes this, not from any action but from the visual impression of the candle’s glow.

All these considerations are just, and force us to enter more deeply into the part played by the wish-fulfillment in the dream, and into the significance of the waking thoughts continued in sleep.

Two main classess of dreams:
    obvoious wish fufillemtns
    where wish fufillments seem hidden due to censor

Origin of dream-wishes:
Where does the wish in the dream originate?
    * wish incited during day but unfufilled
        forecon.
    * conscious before suppressed and unfufilled
        forecon. -> unc.
    * No relation to daily life but originate during the night from supression
        unc.
    * desires originating due to desires created during sleep (hunger/thirst/libido)

    Any wish can incite a dream, but wishes that lead to distorted dreams arise from the unconscious.
    " Thus it would appear that all wishes are of the same value and force for the dream formation."

    Freud doubts that forecnc. unfufilled desires typically result in dream in adults.
    This conforms to the large amount of dream distortion we see.
----------------------------------------------------------
    Adults - Con. Wishes must provoke Unc. wishes in dream formation:

        the structure to supress emotions are stronger in adults.
        Adult dreams are largley distorted which relates to censorhip occuring which indicates an unc. origin of wishes.
        Waking desires of adults likely contain less emotional intesity that unconscious/infantile desires.
        Psychoanalysis consitently reveals a hidden unconsious wish in dreams that has an infantile origin.

    - Relationship between conscious wishes and content to unconscious desires in dream formation:

        Conscious wishes likely only relate to dreams when the incite a subconscious wish.
        "I have a strong doubt whether an unfulfilled wish from the day would suffice to create a dream in an adult."
        "the conscious wish is a dream inciter only if it succeeds in arousing a similar unconscious wish which reinforces it."
        Unc. wishes are always ready to be expressed and find additional power to do so when related to con. emotions.
        Freud goes back on his original point and says dreams have ultimately an infantile origin.

        Repressed wishes have an infantile orign.

        In adults, the dream is prevoked ultimately from an infantile wish.
        Infantile wishes are in the unc.
        In the child, the censor is developing and the wishes from the waking state freely flow from conscious to unconsciousness.

        Wishes from con. life play a minor role in dream formation.
        Dreams incorporate raw material from waking life which are not necessarily wishes.

    Five Categories of Day Residues:
        Freud categorizes the waking thoughts that persist into sleep, influencing the content of dreams:
            Unfinished tasks: Things left undone due to external circumstances.
            Unresolved issues: Problems too difficult to solve during the day.
            Suppressed content: Thoughts actively pushed away during waking life.
            Unconscious triggers: Material excited during the day that resonates with the unconscious.
            Indifferent impressions: Trivial, unnoticed experiences of the day.
            
    Dream Formation:
        The unconscious wish provokes the dream by providing the emotional intensity (or "capital").
        The day residues (conscious material) supply the raw sensory or narrative elements.
        Together, they create a dream that often distorts or disguises the underlying wish.

    conscious residue surely continue to strive for expression during the night.

    foreconscious system relies on the unconscious for energy during sleep. 

    Sleep inhibits the foreconscious system, reducing its ability to process thoughts as it does during wakefulness. This creates an opportunity for unconscious desires to seek expression in the form of dreams.
    The material of the dream—its imagery, events, and themes—is drawn from day remnants (recent impressions, unsolved problems, and suppressed thoughts). However, these residues cannot provoke a dream independently. They become dream material only when aligned with an unconscious wish, which supplies the emotional intensity and motivational energy necessary for dream formation.
    Dreams are thus a fusion: the unconscious wish provides the drive, while the day remnants provide the content. 

    chat - Freud suggests that conscious and unconscious content are connected through a web of symbolic, emotional, and associative links. Conscious wishes alone lack the emotional force to provoke a dream, but when aligned with a resonant unconscious wish, they gain the psychic energy required for dream formation.

    Unc. wishes always strive for expression.
    Unc. wishes may unite wish con. wishes to transfer intensity.

    We terminate a degree of intensity to our con. thoughts when we decide to sleep.
    Good sleepers excel at this.

    These mental processes continuing into sleep may be divided into the following groups: 
        1, That which has not been terminated during the day owing to casual prevention; 
        2, that which has been left unfinished by temporary paralysis of our mental power, i.e. the unsolved; 
        3, that which has been rejected and suppressed during the day. This unites with a powerful group 
        4 formed by that which has been excited in our Unc. during the day by the work of the foreconscious. Finally, we may add group 
        5 consisting of the indifferent and hence unsettled impressions of the day.
    
freuds dream about his freud otto invoked a desire from the unc.
The dream revealed Freud’s repressed competitive desire to see himself in a more favorable light compared to Otto. Otto’s illness in the dream could reflect Freud's unconscious wish to affirm his superiority or feel vindicated.


Why do dreams always have prior day content? Must it be so?

unc. wish must unite with content in forecon. to be expressed in a dream. This does not mean that a 
wish in the con. must unite with an unc. wish, but that there is some uniting or relating of 
con. content with unc. desires.

"But while this freedom from censorship explains only the preference for trivial elements, the constant presence of recent elements points to the fact that there is a need for transference."



- Why can the unconscious furnish the motive power for the wish-fulfillment only during sleep?
    Devlopment of mind, first as a reflex aparatus.
    Inner wants resulted in inner changes or expression of emotions.
    Memory traces become associated with want.
    Wants then revive memories.
    The want comes to revive memories of what satisfied it in the past.
    Reappearance of the past perception constitues wish-fufillment.
    Memories of satisfaction provide a short road to wish fufillment.

    Pirmitive hallucinatory wish fufillment must be modified by eperience to lead to secondary activity.

    As the mind matures it learns to inhibit this short road regression and is instead apt to engage in longterm thinking and behavior which seeks to have the desire fufilled.
    The process making use of psychic energy matures  to inhibit basic hallucination to purposeful action which falls under systems capable of motility.
    "Thinking is indeed nothing but the equivalent of the hallucinatory wish."
    Only wishes engage psychic activity.
    "The dream is a fragment of the abandoned psychic life of the child.
    ... and then betray their inability to satisfy our wants in the outer world."


    thoughts:
        so the implication is that the crying infant learns to associate hunger with the breast of the mother. The child will then enter s stage where their mind simply tries to imagine the breast in an attempt to satisfy want, but through experience will eventually learn to inhibit the need for immediate gratification and will engage in conscious long term behavior which is motivated by base desires such as hunger.

    Primitive mental activity and the "short regressive road":
        In early mental development, the mind’s first response to unmet needs is hallucinatory wish-fulfillment: reviving memory images of past experiences that satisfied the need. For example, a hungry infant might hallucinate the memory of milk or a caregiver’s presence as if the perception could fulfill the need.
        This short regressive path (going backward to memory instead of forward to action) is ineffective because it does not bring real gratification. The want persists because the internal hallucination cannot provide actual satisfaction from the external world.
        Bitter experiences (e.g., failed attempts to gratify needs through hallucination) force the mind to develop more expedient mechanisms.

        Dreams are a product of a primitive mechanism to use memory and hallucination to satisy want.
        Such a hallucinatory mechanism developed as a way to relieve tension and excitement.

    The sleep guardian (censor) reduces repression during sleep while inhibiting motility to allow harmless epression of repressed desires.

    n psychosis, unconscious excitations don’t necessarily create entirely new content but rather distort or amplify existing content by altering how psychic energy (attention and focus) is distributed across the conscious mind.

    We have explained that the reason why the dream is in every case a wish realization is because it is a product of the Unc., which knows no other aim in its activity but the fulfillment of wishes, and which has no other forces at its disposal but wish-feelings.

    Neurotic behavor syptoms are also wish-fufillments of the unc.

    ysterical symptom necessitates the combination of both streams of our psychic life. The symptom is not merely the expression of a realized unconscious wish, but it must be joined by another wish from the foreconscious which is fulfilled by the same symptom; so that the symptom is at least doubly determined.

    an hysterical symptom originates only where two contrasting wish-fulfillments, having their source in different psychic systems, are able to combine in one expression.
