VI THE WISH IN DREAMS

The dream is a continuation of thinking in sleep.

Is it not strange that dreams should purely be wish fufillments?
We've seen before a disgused series of patterns and meanings hidden in dreams, but can we justify that they are all wish fufillements?

courpse dream - where a father reanacts a dangerous situation his child was in seemed provoked by the light of a flame.
A father, whose child has recently died, dreams that the body of the deceased child is in a room. In the dream, a candle falls, potentially setting fire to the body. The father concludes this, not from any action but from the visual impression of the candle’s glow.

All these considerations are just, and force us to enter more deeply into the part played by the wish-fulfillment in the dream, and into the significance of the waking thoughts continued in sleep.

Two main classess of dreams:
    obvoious wish fufillemtns
    where wish fufillments seem hidden due to censor

Origin of dream-wishes:
Where does the wish in the dream originate?
    * wish incited during day but unfufilled
        forecon.
    * conscious before suppressed and unfufilled
        forecon. -> unc.
    * No relation to daily life but originate during the night from supression
        unc.
    * desires originating due to desires created during sleep (hunger/thirst/libido)

    Any wish can incite a dream, but wishes that lead to distorted dreams arise from the unconscious.
    " Thus it would appear that all wishes are of the same value and force for the dream formation."

    Freud doubts that forecnc. unfufilled desires typically result in dream in adults.
    This conforms to the large amount of dream distortion we see.
----------------------------------------------------------
    Adults - Con. Wishes must provoke Unc. wishes in dream formation:

        the structure to supress emotions are stronger in adults.
        Adult dreams are largley distorted which relates to censorhip occuring which indicates an unc. origin of wishes.
        Waking desires of adults likely contain less emotional intesity that unconscious/infantile desires.
        Psychoanalysis consitently reveals a hidden unconsious wish in dreams that has an infantile origin.
    - Relationship between conscious wishes and content to unconscious desires in dream formation:

        Conscious wishes likely only relate to dreams when the incite a subconscious wish.
        "I have a strong doubt whether an unfulfilled wish from the day would suffice to create a dream in an adult."
        "the conscious wish is a dream inciter only if it succeeds in arousing a similar unconscious wish which reinforces it."
        Unc. wishes are always ready to be expressed and find additional power to do so when related to con. emotions.

        Repressed wishes have an infantile orign.

    "The wish manifested in the dream must be an infantile one. In the adult it originates in the Unc., while in the child, where no separation and censor as yet exist between Forec. and Unc., or where these are only in the process of formation, it is an unfulfilled and unrepressed wish from the waking state." 
    This seems evident from the fact that many daily concerns from waking life fail to provoke a dream.

    In adults, the dream is prevoked ultimately from an infantile wish.
    Infantile wishes are in the unc.
    In the child, the censor is developing and the wishes from the waking state freely flow from conscious to unconsciousness.

    Wishes from con. life play a minor role in dream formation.
    Dreams incorporate raw material from waking life which are not necessarily wishes.

    Five Categories of Day Residues:
        Freud categorizes the waking thoughts that persist into sleep, influencing the content of dreams:
            Unfinished tasks: Things left undone due to external circumstances.
            Unresolved issues: Problems too difficult to solve during the day.
            Suppressed content: Thoughts actively pushed away during waking life.
            Unconscious triggers: Material excited during the day that resonates with the unconscious.
            Indifferent impressions: Trivial, unnoticed experiences of the day.
            
    Dream Formation:
        The unconscious wish provokes the dream by providing the emotional intensity (or "capital").
        The day residues (conscious material) supply the raw sensory or narrative elements.
        Together, they create a dream that often distorts or disguises the underlying wish.

    conscious residue surely continue to strive for expression during the night.

    foreconscious system relies on the unconscious for energy during sleep. 

    Sleep inhibits the foreconscious system, reducing its ability to process thoughts as it does during wakefulness. This creates an opportunity for unconscious desires to seek expression in the form of dreams.
    The material of the dream—its imagery, events, and themes—is drawn from day remnants (recent impressions, unsolved problems, and suppressed thoughts). However, these residues cannot provoke a dream independently. They become dream material only when aligned with an unconscious wish, which supplies the emotional intensity and motivational energy necessary for dream formation.
    Dreams are thus a fusion: the unconscious wish provides the drive, while the day remnants provide the content. 

    Freud suggests that conscious and unconscious content are connected through a web of symbolic, emotional, and associative links. Conscious wishes alone lack the emotional force to provoke a dream, but when aligned with a resonant unconscious wish, they gain the psychic energy required for dream formation.
