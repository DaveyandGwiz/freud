ch 2 THE DREAM MECHANISM



Did Freud's dream relate to a desire?

The woman says Freud had beautiful eyes -> wants something for nothing
wanted his wife to pay attention only to him -> like the woman did in the dream.

Some portion of the latent content is a wish, which the dream sees fufilled.

Dream work performs condensation of the dream thoughts.

Dream give an example of a dream at a pool.
He finds that the scene in the dream combines elements from several reminices.

And a memory of Freud's


Freud analyzes his dream. EL places her hand on Freud, like his wife did during their courtship. And her behavior contradicts his wife's.
Freud says that the's associations bring to mind an important event from his courtship.

Freud compares the dream work to Galton, who placed family portraits one over the other to find a common resenblance.

Freud says when a dream scene brings to mind multiple occurances, both were taken into account in the formation of the image.

Dream thoughts overdetermine dream scenes such that a single element in the dream represent the whole of latent thoughts as opposed to just one.

Much like when one creates a slant rhyme, the dream work can combine elements of two latent thoughts that have nothing in common so that they may both be represented.

The dream achieves this double representation by finding an alternative way to represent a thought. 
In freuds dream, the pricipal thought was that he would like to have something for nothing. In his dream this thought is replaced with the thought: "I should like to enjoy something free of cost."

// Kost (meaning taste) is presented by the restaurant. 

It is through condesation that elements within a dream, such as persons, can take on new qualities, as their representation is over determined by the latent dream thoughts.

When in a dream an individual takes on the qualities of different individuals, an implcit comparriosn is being made. The idividual and the new attributes they may take on from other persons denote a sort of similarity being made between them. Only analysis can reveal what the unifying theme is of the 'combined' dream person.

The same rule hold true for non-persons within the dream.
They key to understanding the comparison being made is to remember that the dream excludes unnecesary detail of objects when condensed and emphasis is given to the common characteristic.

The dream says simply: All these things have an "x" in common. 
he decomposition of these mixed images by analysis is often the quickest way to an interpretation of the dream.

Combined image dream:
Freud gives a dream where he is in a carrige carrying a glass hat.
When giving his association on the hat, two ideas came to mind:
1) The expression, "He who keeps his hat in his hand will travel safely through the land."
2) the glass hat reminded me of Auer's light. 
// The Auer gas mantle was a key advancement in gas lighting technology made around Freud's time.

The thought then occured to Freud, that he was about to invent something (psychoanalysis) which would allow him to travel outside of his home cirty of Vienna.

In this way, freud's wish that he would be able to travel by means of his scietific accomplishments was represented with the one condensed image of a glass hat.

Dream condensation, can be formulated as the overdetermination of the manifest content by the matter of dream thoughts. That is, that the dream elements are comprised of the whole of thoguhts which are the basis of the dream.

Said anothr way, one dream element represents more than one dream thought.

Freud then asks, why it is dream thoughts are condensed in dream work?

"condensation and dramatization do not wholly account for the difference between dream contents and dream thoughts. There is evidence of a third factor, which deserves careful consideration."

Freud realizes through analysis that dream thoughts are always represented by the contents of a dream, but yet there still some significant difference between the content of the dream and the thoughts that underly them.

This must be the third factor, past condensation and dramtization, which forms dreams.

In terms of importance, the dream thoughts and the dream content seem to be inversley related.
That is, the content which is most prominent in the dream seem least important when the underlying thoughts are identified.
Conversely, the dream thoughts which seem most important emotionally may be absent from direct representation in the dream or may be only represented by allusion. 

"the phenomena: During the dream work the psychical intensity of those thoughts and conceptions to which it properly pertains flows to others which, in my judgment, have no claim to such emphasis."

this process seems to conceal the dream's meaning.

Freud calls the process, dream displacement.

Freud writes, " During this process, which I will call the dream displacement, I notice also the psychical intensity, significance, or emotional nature of the thoughts become transposed in sensory vividness. What was clearest in the dream seems to me, without further consideration, the most important; but often in some obscure element of the dream I can recognize the most direct offspring of the principal dream thought."

Many dream have minimal displacement, and it can take place to varying degrees.

Freud shows how displacement took place in his one dream where the dreams most prominent feature was the Ms. EL making an advance towards freud while the most import underlying thought or theme was Freud's desire for love that will cost nothing, which lies behind the womans statement and even the sscene of the restaurant.

When displacement is overcome throught the psychoanalytical method, it becomes clear what provokes a dream and what its relation to waking life is.

Freud states that all dreams are connected to thoughts from the previous day. However, the process of displacement shifts the emphasis from significant events to trivial details. This gives the impression that the dream is preoccupied with unimportant matters, obscuring its true meaning.

Read the next paragraph.
Ends:
The dream does never trouble itself about things which are not deserving of our concern during the day, and trivialities which do not trouble us during the day have no power to pursue us whilst asleep.

The dream was triggered by the taxi cab ride, which brought to Freud's mind the sum of money he lent a family member.
So while an important event is the ultimate source of a dream, what triggers a dream must be somehow related to the day before.

Between condensation and displacement, we find that the dream only represents the dream thoughts in a somewhat abstract, symbolic, or poetic way: "The first dream thoughts which are unravelled by analysis frequently strike one by their unusual wording. They do not appear to be expressed in the sober form which our thinking prefers; rather are they expressed symbolically by allegories and metaphors like the figurative language of the poets."


Freud also notes that dream thoughts commonly reveal associations of childhood memories.
Childhood memories serves as a crystalized basis upon which our dream thoughts collect.
Freud says that commonly he finds the dream to be a modified repition of childhood experiences.

Dreams include scattered material. How are dreams dramatized?

Dream thoughts are connected by logic and assocations, but commpression collapses them into a dream scene. Analysis must reveal the connection between dream thoughts.

So while thoughts have differnet connections, the dream scene collapses representations in time and space, like a painter.

Thoughts are related by negation, but a dream scene cant represent 'not.'
Instead, a dream represents conflicting ideas through other means, like transforamation and disagreement.

Freud: "Absurdity (or paradox) in the dream denotes disagreement, scorn, disdain in the dream thoughts"
 

Example: Mr. M.  ruined by Goethe. 

 The self in the dream represents Freud combined with his friend and signles his free of being attacked.

Goethe’s attack on Mr. M symbolizes the unjust criticism Freud’s friend faced.
The absurdity (a great figure attacking an insignificant one).

"How absurd that someone so insignificant could criticize someone great (like my friend)!


regard for intelligibility: which is the final elaboration of the dream, a sort of preliminary interpretation.
"which behaves towards the actual dream content just as our normal psychical action behaves towards some proffered perception that is to our liking. The dream content is thus secured under the pretense of certain expectations."
"Every one is aware that we are unable to look at any series of unfamiliar signs, or to listen to a discussion of unknown words, without at once making perpetual changes through our regard for intelligibility, through our falling back upon what is familiar."

Freyd says, this process influences dream content that has already been built up.

Inteligibity key take away:
Freud’s regard for intelligibility reflects the dream work's effort to impose a false sense of order on the dream’s content. While this makes the dream appear more understandable, it often conceals the deeper latent thoughts, which can only be uncovered through psychoanalysis.

Dream Work Summarrized:
Dream work consists soley in: condensation, displacement, dramatization, and super  elaboration (preliminary).
Everything else in the manifest dream can be found within the latent dream thoughts.
That is, the dream does not create entirely new material, as analysis demonstrates.

In this way, we may compare the dream work to the workings of an LLM: ream Work is Transformative, Not Creative.
The latent content is given. and the dream work consists in using said material to create a represtation of it in the dream. The four step process:
1) Condense material
2) displacement of material (varying degress)
3) dramatize material in scenes
4) and impose a superficial elboration or meaning onto the manifest dream 

The underlying thoughts, or raw data, to which the above happen are not created in the dream work itself. 

example: the patient going to the butcher.

example: Lady whose daughter takes more coins than necessary.

example: 10 years married dream: Neednt be in such a hurry.
She regrets hurrying to a theater, like she feels about her merriage.
