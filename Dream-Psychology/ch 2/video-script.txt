ch 2 THE DREAM MECHANISM


- Dream of Adults: Freud's dream analyzed
Did Freud's dream relate to a desire?

We know for children, that dreams seem to be the realization of a wish during the proceeding day.
What we dont yet know is if that theory holds for adults that seem to have rather strange dreams.

After analyzing his own dream, Freud indetifies that his wife had recently been preoddupied with guests he wanted to avoid.
But in the dream, the woman sitting next to him gives him her undivided attention.

So the dream seems to be the realization of what Freud had wanted.

The principal thought of freud's ananlysis was that he would like love that consts him nothing.
The dream character of Ms EL says to freud "you've always had such beautiful eyes."

Implying that people do things for him simply out of love.

The more the Freud connects the dots, the more it seems as though the strange dream did mean to placate some sort of desire.

It's clear that some portion of the latent content is a wish, which the dream sees fufilled.

The compex nature of the dream is due in part to some type of condensation.
Freud's dream seem to be a mix of elements:
    the daughter of a man freud owed money
    the woman paying attention to freud
    the dream takes place in a restaurant, where kost means taste in German.

It's clear freud says that Dream work performs condensation of the underlying dream thoughts.

- First Mechanism: Condensation

The dream combines many underlying thoughts when creating a dream.

Dream give an example of a dream at a pool.
He finds that the scene in the dream combines elements from several reminices.

    And a memory of Freud's

Freud futher analyzes his own dream and notices subtle details that further relate to freuds experiences
with love and debt.
    Freud analyzes his dream. EL places her hand on Freud, like his wife did during their courtship. And her behavior contradicts his wife's.
    Freud says that the's associations bring to mind an important event from his courtship.

Freud compares the dream work to Galton, who placed family portraits one over the other to find a common resenblance.

Freud says when a dream scene brings to mind multiple occurances, both were taken into account in the formation of the image.

Dream thoughts overdetermine dream scenes such that a single element in the dream represent the whole of latent thoughts as opposed to just one.

Much like when one creates a slant rhyme, the dream work can combine elements of two latent thoughts that have nothing in common 
so that they may both be represented.

The dream achieves this double representation by finding an alternative way to represent a thought. 
In the dream, the pricipal thought was that he would like to have something for nothing. In his dream this thought is replaced with the thought:
 "I should like to enjoy something free of cost."

// Kost (meaning taste) is presented by the restaurant. 


- Individuals in dreams

Much like the dream itself, characters within the dream may be combinations of several immpressions.
It is through condesation that elements within a dream, such as persons, can take on new qualities, as their representation is 
overdetermined by the latent dream thoughts.

When in a dream an individual takes on the qualities of different individuals, an implcit comparriosn is being made. 
The idividual and the new attributes they may take on from other persons denote a sort of similarity being made between them. 
Only analysis can reveal what the unifying theme is of the 'combined' dream person.

The same rule hold true for non-persons within the dream.
They key to understanding the comparison being made is to remember that the dream excludes unnecesary detail of objects when condensed and 
emphasis is given to the common characteristic.

The dream says simply: All these things, or people, have an "x" in common. 
Freud says, The decomposition of these mixed images by analysis is often the quickest way to an interpretation of the dream.

- Example of a Combined Image Dream
 
Freud gives a dream where he is in a carrige carrying a glass hat.
When giving his association on the hat, two ideas came to mind:
1) The expression, "He who keeps his hat in his hand will travel safely through the land."
2) the glass hat reminded me of Auer's light. 
// The Auer gas mantle was a key advancement in gas lighting technology made around Freud's time.
 innovation in gas lighting technology i

The thought then occured to Freud, that he was about to invent something (psychoanalysis) which would allow him to travel outside of his 
home cirty of Vienna.

In this way, freud's wish that he would be able to travel by means of his scietific accomplishments was represented with the one condensed image 
of a glass hat.

Dream condensation: can be formulated as the overdetermination of the manifest content by the matter of dream thoughts. 
That is, that the dream elements are comprised of the whole of thoguhts which are the basis of the dream.

Said another way, one dream element represents more than one dream thought.

It is through condensation that the dream is dramatized, that is the underlying thoughts are combined through themes and then made into a vivid
collection of scenes or images.


- The Third Factor: Displacement 

Freud notices however that while the thoughts given by analyzing the dream give rise to impressions that are simalr to the dream content.
That doesnt explain why it is the manifest dream seems so different from the latent thoughts.

Freud writes:
"condensation and dramatization do not wholly account for the difference between dream contents and dream thoughts. 
There is evidence of a third factor, which deserves careful consideration."

This must be the third factor, past condensation and dramtization, which forms dreams.

Freud notices that:
in terms of importance, the dream thoughts and the dream content seem to be inversley related.
The content which is most prominent in the dream seems least important when the underlying thoughts are identified.
Conversely, the dream thoughts which seem most important emotionally may be absent from direct representation in the dream 
or may be only represented by allusion. 

It's this process that seems to conceal the dream's meaning or make it less obvious.

Freud calls this process, dream displacement.

Freud writes, " During this process, which I will call the dream displacement, I notice also the psychical intensity, significance, 
or emotional nature of the thoughts become transposed in sensory vividness. What was clearest in the dream seems to me, 
without further consideration, the most important; but often in some obscure element of the dream I can recognize the most direct 
offspring of the principal dream thought."

Many dream have minimal displacement, and it can take place to varying degrees.

Freud shows how displacement took place in his one dream where the dreams most prominent feature was the Ms. EL making an advance towards him
 while the most import underlying thought or theme was Freud's desire for love that will cost nothing, which lies behind the womans statement 
 and even the scene of the restaurant.

When displacement is overcome throught the psychoanalytical method, it becomes clear what provokes a dream and what its relation to waking life is.

While all dreams are connected to thoughts from the previous day, the process of displacement shifts the emphasis from significant events to 
trivial details. This gives the impression that the dream is preoccupied with unimportant matters, obscuring its true meaning.

Read the next paragraph.
Ends:
The dream does never trouble itself about things which are not deserving of our concern during the day, and trivialities which do not trouble us during the day have no power to pursue us whilst asleep.



The dream was triggered by the taxi cab ride, which brought to Freud's mind the sum of money he lent a family member.
So while an important event is the ultimate source of a dream, what triggers a dream must be somehow related to the day before.

Between condensation and displacement, we find that the dream only represents the dream thoughts in a somewhat abstract, symbolic, or poetic way: "The first dream thoughts which are unravelled by analysis frequently strike one by their unusual wording. They do not appear to be expressed in the sober form which our thinking prefers; rather are they expressed symbolically by allegories and metaphors like the figurative language of the poets."

- The Final Mechanism Freud lists: Intelligibility

regard for intelligibility: which is the final elaboration of the dream, a sort of preliminary interpretation.

Intelligebility "behaves towards the actual dream content just as our normal psychical action behaves towards some proffered perception
 that is to our liking. The dream content is thus secured under the pretense of certain expectations."

"Every one is aware that we are unable to look at any series of unfamiliar signs, or to listen to a discussion of unknown words, 
without at once making perpetual changes through our regard for intelligibility, through our falling back upon what is familiar."

Freud says, this process, intellgebility,influences dream content that has already been built up.

Inteligibity key take away:
Freud’s regard for intelligibility reflects the dream work's effort to impose a false sense of order on the dream’s content. 
While this makes the dream appear more understandable, but it often conceals the deeper latent thoughts, which can only be uncovered through psychoanalysis.



- To Summarize
Dream Work Summarrized:
Dream work consists soley in: condensation, displacement, dramatization, and super elaboration (intelligibility).
Everything else in the manifest dream can be found within the latent dream thoughts.
That is, the dream does not create entirely new material, as analysis demonstrates.

In this way, we may compare the dream work to the workings of an LLM: dream Work is Transformative, Not Creative.

So to reiterate,
once the latent content is given, the dream work consists in using said material to create a represtation of it in the dream. 
It does so in a four step process:
    1) Condense material
    2) displacement of material (varying degress)
    3) dramatize material in scenes
    4) and impose a superficial elboration, or meaning, onto the manifest dream
