Dreams Before Freud:
* Gods, accidental production of the brain during sleep.
* Dreams have meaning.

* Dreams understood via analysis (associations).

Freud's Dream:

The dream is a substitution for thoughts.

manifest content - The dream images
latent content - the thoughts tied to the dream.

dream work - the transformation of thoughts into dreams.

3 types of dreams:
* intelligebale and related to our lives.
* Intelligeble, coherent, but seem unrelated to our life.
* incoherent, complicated, and meaningless. // most dreams of adults

In child dreams, latent and manifest content are similar.
Dreams are related to realization of a wish from the day before.
