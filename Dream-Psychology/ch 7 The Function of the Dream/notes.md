ch 7 THE FUNCTION OF THE DREAM

Day remnants remain in forecon. 
The unconscious wish supplies the energy to produce a dream, but may transfer energy to day remnants.

The unc. wish may transfer energy to day remneants.
The revived wish seeks to express itself but meets censor when moving to forec.


Waking activity can excite unc. wishes.
During the day, the unc. wishes can transfer enegery to con wishes.
During dreams the unc wishes seeks to enter forecon. but meets distortion.

It now takes on the distortion for which the way has already been paved by its transference to the recent material.
