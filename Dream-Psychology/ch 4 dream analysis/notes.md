ch 4 Dream Analysis

Abondoning the matter of the psychic aparatus, that is the division between the unconscious and conscious that we explored last chapter, Feud returns to the topic of dreams.

In this chapter We ask, How can disagreeable content in dream be seen as a wish fifillment?

Due to disfigurement, disagreeable content serves to disguise a wish.

Remember, in the mind there are two psychic instances, one conscious and one unconscious.
What is disagreeable to consciousness may still serve to express a repressed wish in the inconscious.


In this chapter, Freud lists dream which only on the surface seem to not be wish fufillments, but yet still represent an underlying desire.


--In the following dream, Freud gives the dream of a patient who is unable to host a supper --

The dream is as follows:â€”

"I want to give a supper, but having nothing at hand except some smoked salmon, I think of going marketing, but I remember that it is Sunday afternoon, when all the shops are closed. I next try to telephone to some caterers, but the telephone is out of order.... Thus I must resign my wish to give a supper."

In freuds analysis, he begins with analyzing the stimulus from the previous day.

The patient is rather in love with her husband, however, she is rather thin and her husband likes curvier figures.

A woman friend had recently joined them for supper, and had expressed the desire to comeback to eat at their house again. She had alos mentioned the desire to put on additional weight.

The friend has a naturally cury figure that the patient is jealous of.

The dream seem to be a desire to keep the woman from coming back to the house and eating so that she can become even more pleasing to her husband.

After Freud gives this inturrpretation of the dream, the woman then recals that this woman's favorite dish is salmon.


-- Idenitification --

We see in the above example a sort of identification occuring in the dream.
The wish of the patient relates to the dream of her friend.

The above dream is both a wish for the woman to not get a curvier figure.
Which is in a way a wish for someone else's wish to not be fufilled.

Freud notes that Hysterical Identification is something commonly occuring in dreams.
It occurs when individuals with who the dreamer identifies' wishes are reprsented in a dream.

In the dream, the patient represents her friend's desire to gain weight by symbolizing her own unfulfilled wish of hosting a dinner. 

By expressing her own unsatisfied desire, the patient unconsciously identifies with her friend's state of deprivation.

The dream represents not just her own desires but the desire of her friend as well who she unconsciously sees as a rival for her husband's affection.

Freud writes,
"She puts herself in the place of her friend in the dream, because her friend has taken her own place relation to her husband, and because she would like to take her friend's place in the esteem of her husband."



-- Contradiction of Wishes in dreams --

Sometimes the denial of one wihs can mean the fufillment of another wish.
Freud gives the example of one patient who dreamnt that she was going to visit her mother in law.
In reality the dreamer dislikes her mother in law and goes at great lengths to avoid her.
This dream oaccord after the woman learned of freuds view that dreams are a wish ffuillment.

"According to this dream, I was in the wrong. It was thus her wish that I should be in the wrong, and this wish the dream showed her as fulfilled."

The woman had wished to prove freud wrong as she did not approve of the inturrpretation of a dream freud gave her before.
The dream represented a wish to give evidence that would prove freud wrong.



-- Painful Dream Death of Sister's Child ---
Even a dream containing painful content can represent the fufillment of a wish.
Haring Freuds theory, the patient wonders if she is horrible enough to wish for the death of her nephew.
After analysis freud finds that in the particular woman has a love interest that she would be able to meet again if her nephew were to have a funeral.
This painful dream is a fufillment of a wish to reconnect with her love interest, while containing content that is obviously still painful.

Even in this dream we see displacement. As the sorrow in the dream serves to hide the dreamer's supressed longing for the man she lhas loved for a long time.


--- Long Surpressed Wish ---

In another example Freud tells of a dream that has long been supressed.
In her dream, the woman's 15 year old daughter lay dead in a box.

After learning more about the patient's history he discovers that the woman had not wanted to become a mother and had hoped to have a miscarriage.

The dream is a symbolic reprsentation of this long supressed wish that the child may die in the womb (box).


-- counter wish-dreams ---
Frued calls many of the example in this section counter wish-dreams as they fufill one wish while still containing content which is contrary to other desires.

A very clear species of such dreams occur in masochism where the desires fufillment necessarily entials some degree of suffering.

-- Masochism in dreams --

Freud gives a final example of a dream in which a person has been financially ruined by his brother with whom he has both feelings of guilt for his treatment of during childhood and some romantic feelings.

The dream represents a desire to be punished for his mistreatment of his brother.
