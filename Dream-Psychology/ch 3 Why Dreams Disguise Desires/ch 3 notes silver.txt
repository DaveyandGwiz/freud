- ch 3 Why Drea Disguses the Desires

Displacement which obscures dream meaning has a motive.
As amalysis continues, thoughts are revealed which are foreign/painful.
Analysis forces us to consider that these thoughts belong to us.
These revealed thoguts have an energy or intensity.

The thoughts were hidden from consciousness.
Repression is the mechanism that keeps thoughts hidden from consciousness.

Dream works includes distortion.
Displacement serves to disguise thoughts.

What is freud's repressed thopguht?
Freud realized regretting the payment he made.

Recogniton of hidden dream thoguths minimizes neurosis.

Freud mentions the neurotic woman whose dream revealed she did not love her husband.

Three categories of dream revisted:
    1) Dreams where desire is undiguesed
    2) Dreams where desire is disgused, but it's realization is clear
    3) Dreams where the desire is hidden and the realization of the desire isnt not obvious.

These categories reflect varying degrees of repression and displacement, with the third category being the most challenging to interpret and analyze.
// above appears incorrect.

1) Dreams witn non-repressed or concealed desires.
2) Dreams which repreent a desire in veiled from.
    That is, the desire itself is repressed and the relization of the desire is veiled.
    Example the woman who dreams of a funeral so she can see the man she loves.
3) Dreams where the desire is repressed but its realization has minimal concealment.
    In these dreams, feelings of desire are replaced by anxiety. 
    This will be elaborated on.

A painful dream is not necessarily an aniety filled dream of the third class.

- Two Procedures for thought generation
    1) Available to enter consciousness
    2) Complete unconc. No conc. access

    Between these the content of these procedures is a censor.
    Censor dictates if uncon. thoughts can reach the semi-conc.
    The censor is what represses cetain thoughts.

    Repressed thoughts reach conc. during sleep in distorted form during dream formation.

    Lax of the censor:
        Compromise is Key:

        The content of the dream reflects a compromise between the repressed desires (seeking expression) and the censorâ€™s residual resistance (seeking to suppress these desires).
        The Censor is less active during sleep, but still has some influence.

The forgetting of dreams is in part due to activity of the censor in waking state.

- Ego During sleep
    The ego desires continued sleep.
    def: The ego is the part of the psyche responsible for balancing internal desires (id) with external reality and social norms. 
    Ego suprress desires and disruptive thoughts furing the day.
    During seep ego supression is weakend but suppresses enough to prevent waking.
    The ego also monitors external stimulia. Freud gives examples.

A dream can be allowed to wake us, do to dread.
Here the dream serves to wake us.
Night watchman analogy.

Conditions where the ego may wake us:
    1) To escape the dream when its content overwhelms the mechanisms of distortion and threatens psychological balance during sleep.
    2) To address the repressed thoughts or external stimuli that the dream signals as urgent or demanding conscious action.


External stimuli can be represented in sleeping dreams or can wake us during certain conditions.

- Dreams and Sexual Desires and Dream Symbolism

    Dream often represent sexual desires in adults.
    Dreams can represent erotic desires asexually through allusions.
    Here we introduce the idea of dream "symbols"

    Example: a king and queen represent the parents, ie universal symbols.
    Even modern sysmbols can represent sexual objects ie a plane.

    Relative meaning also exits in relation to symbols dreams.
    We most probe the patient in analysis to understand this relation.
