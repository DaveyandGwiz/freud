ch III - WHY THE DREAM DISGUISES THE DESIRES


we now that dreams disguise desires and are made of thoughts from our waking life.
In the last chapter, we discussied the prcesses that occur in the formation of a dream.

In this chapter we discuss why it is that displacement occurs and probe deeper into the reasons
the dreams typical of adults seem so strange and obscure.

Freud opens by noting that processes in dream work like condesation and displacement occur in other symptoms of mental disorders like neurosis and obession.
--
Displacement is the strangest of all dream work. According to freud it is fundemantally motivated.
That is, the reason for the distotion in dream work where the thoughts seem somehow hidden by the
image of the dream, corresponds to some want to conceal.
While Freud doesnt give us the full analysis, he tells us as he continued to examine his dream 
which takes place in the restaurant, he found that it seemed to suggest ideas and feelings
that Freud did not immediately recognize.
In fact the thoughts appeared both foreign and unpleasent.
But as Freud continued analyzing his dream and his own associations to it, he was forced to acknowledge that these suggested underlying thoughts really were part of his waking life.

Freud says that once he finally analyzed his dream, not only did find that he desired love that would cost him nothing, but he also found that he regretted the sum of money he lent to a particular member of his family.

Freud calls the process by which thoughts are hidden from our consciouness mind, repression.
And dream distortion is the process by which displacement and repression serve to hide the meaning of a dream.

--
Freud now identies that the obscure dreams typicall of audlts are wish fufillments but they are "They are concealed realizations of repressed desires."
And it's only through analysis we come to realize this.

--
Working with this improved theory we can now identify 3 categories of dream with repression in mind:
Three Categories of Dreams and Concealment (Expanded)
Dreams with non-repressed, unconcealed desires:

These are straightforward dreams, often of an infantile type, where the desire is directly realized.
Rare in adults because most desires are repressed in mature psychic structures.
Dreams with veiled representation of repressed desires:

The desire itself is repressed, and its realization is also concealed or disguised through dream distortion.
Example: A woman dreams of a funeral, but the underlying desire is to see the man she loves. The funeral is a veil for her longing.
Dreams with repressed desires and minimal concealment:

The desire remains repressed, but its realization in the dream is not heavily disguised.
Instead of distortion through concealment, these dreams provoke dread or anxiety that replaces the representation of the desire.
Example: Intense dread in the dream often stems from what was once a strong desire but has since been repressed.

Distinction Between Repression and Concealment
Repression: A dynamic, unconscious process where unacceptable thoughts or desires are kept out of conscious awareness entirely.
Concealment: A feature of dream work where repressed desires are distorted or disguised to appear less threatening, allowing them to bypass the censor.
Key difference:

Repression occurs before the dream work, keeping the desire unconscious.
Concealment occurs during the dream work, altering how the repressed material is represented in the manifest content.
--

Freud then gives the example of the woman who dreamed her sisters child died.

A woman dreams of her sister’s child, Charles, lying dead in a coffin, mirroring the scene of her nephew Otto’s funeral years prior.
Freud interprets this as a disguised wish to see a professor she loved, who had reappeared during Otto’s funeral.
The dream uses the distressing image to conceal her longing for the professor under a tragic scenario.


-- Elaboration on repression---

Working with the theory that there are thoughts that are hidden, or unaccessible to consciousness, we identify two Procedures for Thought Generation 
Two Procedures for Thought Generation
    Conscious or pre-conscious thought processes:
        These thoughts can reach consciousness without resistance.
    Unconscious thought processes:
        These are completely inaccessible to consciousness unless mediated.

The censor is the wall between the two systems. Allowng some material to be retrieved but blocking others.
    A censor exists between these systems, acting as a gatekeeper to block unacceptable unconscious thoughts.
    Repressed thoughts and desires:
        During sleep, these may bypass the censor, but they reach consciousness only in distorted form, mediated by the dream work

-- Firewall analogy--
Firewall Analogy for the Censor
    Think of the censor as a firewall protecting a computer system.
    Repressed desires are akin to potential viruses that the firewall blocks during the day.
    During sleep, when the firewall (censor) is less active, these desires have more freedom to attempt penetration into consciousness.
    However, to get past the firewall, these desires must be disguised—finding "intelligent ways" (e.g., distortion through displacement or symbolism) to bypass the censor without triggering a full block.


----Transition to how the dream protects sleep---

"We now understand that, much like in children, dreams are always the expression of desires that might otherwise disturb sleep. Freud elaborates on how the dream mechanism serves to protect rest by managing external stimuli, bodily discomfort, and the disturbance of repressed desires seeking expression while the censor is in a weakened state during sleep."






#### **The Role of the Censor During Sleep**
- The **censor** is less active during sleep, allowing repressed thoughts to surface in distorted forms within dreams.
- The **compromise** between repressed desires and the censor’s residual resistance shapes the dream’s content.
- Upon waking, the censor resumes full activity, contributing to the **forgetting of dreams**.

---

#### **The Ego During Sleep**
- The **ego** prioritizes maintaining sleep and suppresses disruptive thoughts or desires that could cause waking.
- During sleep, the ego’s control over repression is weakened, but it still regulates enough to allow sleep to continue.
- The ego monitors **external stimuli** and integrates them into dreams, such as incorporating noises into dream narratives.

---

#### **When Dreams Wake Us**
- A dream can wake us if it evokes **dread or anxiety** that overwhelms the mechanisms of distortion.
- **Night Watchman Analogy**:
  - The ego acts like a watchman, waking the dreamer only when necessary, either to escape the dream’s psychological impact or to respond to external stimuli.

Conditions for waking:
1. **To escape the dream**: If the content threatens psychological balance during sleep.
2. **To address urgent stimuli**: When internal or external demands necessitate conscious action.

---

#### **External Stimuli and Dreams**
- External stimuli during sleep:
  - Can be incorporated into dreams (e.g., noise becomes applause).
  - May cause waking under certain conditions.
- **Example**:
  - A person hearing clapping in a dream wakes to realize the sound was someone beating a carpet.

---

#### **Dreams and Sexual Desires**
- Many dreams represent **sexual desires**, but these desires are often disguised or symbolized.
- **Symbolism in Dreams**:
  - Universal symbols (e.g., king and queen for parents).
  - Modern symbols (e.g., a plane symbolizing sexual objects).
- Symbolism reflects both **universal** meanings shared across cultures and **individual** meanings tied to personal experiences.

---

### **Key Additions**
- **Dreams as a Compromise**:
  - Dreams balance repressed desires with the ego’s need for sleep, creating a psychical release while maintaining rest.
- **Function of Dreams**:
  - Dreams serve to preserve sleep by offering a release for repressed desires, satisfying both the unconscious drive and the ego’s demand for continued rest.
